# Coach design notes
Purpose:
This document captures coaching philosophy, realism rules, drill structure patterns, and future feature intent.
It is not required reading for execution tasks.
It exists to prevent loss of coaching intent over time.

## Effort model
Five effort zones are used. They map to perceived ability to speak.
Zone 1: chatting, conversation pace
Zone 2: phrases, less conversational
Zone 3: single words
Zone 4: hard to speak
Zone 5: unable to speak

Icons can be replaced later with custom dolphin themed art.

## Drill philosophy
Drills are for feel and awareness, not suffering.
Effort is often low even when distance is meaningful.
Variation should come from drill choice, mixing drill with swim, and coaching cues.

Catch up drill can be useful even if imperfect. It helps swimmers feel timing errors, then compare to normal stroke.

## Realistic set structure rules
Unrealistic patterns to avoid:
- 11 x 50 as a default pattern. Coaches usually choose 8, 10, 12, sometimes 6 or 16.
- Too many repeats of the same drill without variation.
- Drill sets that behave like main sets in intensity.

Realistic drill patterns:
- 8 x 50 drill
- 10 x 50 drill
- 12 x 50 drill
- 6 x 100 drill
- 4 x 100 drill with mixed drills

Very common pattern in any pool:
- One length drill, one length swim, focusing on the drill sensation in the swim length.

Drill sets should often include a list of drill options, not a single drill repeated endlessly.

## Coaching cues
A good set includes a cue about what to focus on.
Examples:
- Long strokes, stay efficient as effort increases
- Hold water on the catch
- Keep cadence controlled
- Maintain body line and quiet kick
- Breathe without disrupting balance

AI coaching value later:
- Provide cues based on goals
- Ask how it felt and adapt guidance
- Explain drills with links and short descriptions

## Drill list direction
Start with common drills that most swimmers know:
- Finger drag
- Catch up
- Fist
- Single arm
- Scull
- Shark fin
- Swivels
- Rotations

Later expand with more complex drills:
- 6 1 6
- 6 3 6
- Kick on side
- Jazz hands

Long term:
Include short how to text and optional video links per drill.
